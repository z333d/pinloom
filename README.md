## Out of sight. Within reach.

Every screenshot you take hangs on a line just above your screen.
Rest the pointer in the menu bar and it glides down. Move away and it's gone.

## A gesture for everything.

## Your Desktop. Finally clear.

Hand Tendedero your screenshots<sup>1</sup> and they skip the Desktop
entirely. No floating thumbnail. No five-second wait. Each capture hangs
the instant you take it, and only what you drag out is kept.

Same shortcuts. Same muscle memory. Just less mess.

<br>

## Private by design.

No account. No network. No analytics.
Tendedero runs entirely on your Mac, and your screenshots never leave it.

## Tech Specs

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Compatibility** | macOS 14 Sonoma or later, on Apple silicon and Intel. Designed for macOS 27. |
| **Size** | 1.7 MB |
| **Languages** | English, Spanish |
| **Built with** | Swift, AppKit and SwiftUI |
| **Network access** | None |
| **Price** | Free |
| **License** | MIT for the code. The name and icon are not included. |

## Install

Download the disk image from the [latest release](../../releases/latest),
open it and drag Tendedero to Applications. Or install it with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask alejandrobujan/tap/tendedero
```

Tendedero is signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple, so it opens
like any other app.

<br>

## Build from source

```sh
git clone git@github.com:alejandrobujan/tendedero.git
cd tendedero
scripts/build-app.sh
open build/Tendedero.app
```

Requires the Swift toolchain. Xcode is optional. With the Command Line Tools for macOS 27, the script falls back to the macOS 26 SDK they install alongside, because the new SDK needs a SwiftUI macro plugin only Xcode includes. Local builds are signed ad hoc,
so macOS asks again for access to the Desktop after each rebuild.

<summary>Inside the app</summary>
<br>

| File | Role |
|:--|:--|
| `AppDelegate.swift` | Menu bar, shortcut, revealing and tucking away the line |
| `LinePanel.swift` | The transparent strip along the top of the screen |
| `LineView.swift` | The line and where each photo hangs |
| `PeggedView.swift` | One photo: glass frame, clip, swing and breeze |
| `GrabArea.swift` | Click, long press, drag and drop |
| `ScreenshotWatcher.swift` | Notices new screenshots |
| `Inbox.swift` | Takes over screenshot settings and puts them back |
| `Markup.swift` | Opens the system Markup editor and saves the result |
| `FullScreen.swift` | Knows when to stay hidden |
| `Line.swift` | What is hanging, and what you can do with it |

Every image here, the icon included, is drawn in code by
`scripts/make-icon.swift` and `scripts/make-readme-art.swift`.
`scripts/make-dmg.sh` builds the disk image for releases.

Translations live in `Sources/Tendedero/Resources`, one `.lproj` folder per
language. `swift scripts/check-strings.swift` checks that none is missing.

<sub>
1. On first launch, Tendedero offers to handle your screenshots. If you accept, it turns off the floating thumbnail and saves new screenshots to its own folder, two settings also found under Options in Cmd+Shift+5. Your previous settings are saved and restored when Tendedero quits or the option is turned off from the menu bar. Tendedero hides automatically while an app is in full screen.
